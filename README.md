# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Hybrid CNN-LSTM & ARIMA

##  Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive Time Series Analysis and Forecasting pipeline for stock market data. The goal was to compare traditional statistical methods (**ARIMA**) against modern Deep Learning architectures (**Hybrid CNN-LSTM**) to predict future stock prices with high accuracy.

**Key Achievements:**
* Achieved **2.5% MAPE** using a Rolling ARIMA Forecast (Walk-Forward Validation).
* Achieved **Adjusted R² of 0.85** using a Hybrid 1D CNN-LSTM model.
* Demonstrated end-to-end data pipeline from EDA and Statistical Testing to Model Deployment.
